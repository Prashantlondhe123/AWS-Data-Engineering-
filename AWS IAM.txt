# AWS IAM :  AWS Identity and Access Management
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users. You use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources (authentication) and what resources they can use and in what ways (authorization).

#Component of IAM : 
- Users
-Group 
- Role 
- Policies

##Programmatic access:
Programmatic access users in IAM is required if you want to control or access your AWS services from the command line via AWS CLI tools. A programmatic access user will be given AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key, which your AWS CLI tools will use to authenticate to AWS and execute your commands.
Programmatic access user for AWS can be created from the IAM dashboard.

#User :
Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

# Group:
-The users created, can also be divided among groups, and then the rules and policies that apply on the group, apply on the user level as well.

#Roles:
-An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests. IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.

# Policies : 
-To assign permissions to a user, group, role, or resource, you create a policy, which is a document that explicitly lists permissions.
