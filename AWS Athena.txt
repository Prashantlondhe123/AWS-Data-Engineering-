#Amazon Athena : 
-Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive analytics service built on open-source frameworks, supporting open-table and file formats. Athena provides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it lives. Analyze data or build applications from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) data lake and 25-plus data sources, including on-premises data sources or other cloud systems using SQL or Python. Athena is built on open-source Trino and Presto engines and Apache Spark frameworks, with no provisioning or configuration effort required
-Get a streamlined, near-instant startup of SQL or Apache Spark analytics workloads with a serverless experience.
-Build interactive, advanced analytics applications using data on premises, in your data lake, or in cloud stores.
-Gain flexibility with support for choice of language, open-data formats, open-source frameworks, and BI and machine learning (ML) tool integration.

#What is Athena?
-Serverless big data analysis
-No infrastructure maintenance - pay for the amount of data scanned
-Use familiar SQL on raw data stored in S3
-Store your data in S3 as CSV, JSON, Parquet and others
-Automatic parallel execution for fast performance

#Limitations and Best Practices: 
-Queries are asynchronous, best effort execution
-Large queries take longer and are more expensive
-Performance limitations for complex queries
-Not suitable for latency sensitive applications
-Powerful when combined with data ingestion services like Kinesis Firehose
