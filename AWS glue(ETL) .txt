# AWS Glue :
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easier to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources for analytics, machine learning (ML), and application development

1]Discover, prepare, and integrate all your data at any scale
2]Build and manage a modern data pipeline with a single data integration service.
3]Keep costs low and focus more on your data at any scale with serverless data in
tegration.
4]Use your favorite method: drag and drop, write code, or connect using your notebook.
5]Support various data processing methods and workloads, including ETL, ELT, batch, and streaming.

################ Data Catalog : 

# Advantage:
- monitor amd debug ETL job and track usage 
-Connect to your data store 
-orchestra job to build data pipe line
-manage and protect data
-visually clean and prepare data set for analysis
-administration

#Connection in AWS glue data catalog:
-An AWS Glue connection is a Data Catalog object that stores login credentials, URI strings, virtual private cloud (VPC) information, and more for a particular data store. AWS Glue crawlers, jobs, and development endpoints use connections in order to access certain types of data stores

1) Marketplace Connector 
2) Custom connector

# Crawler:
-You can use a crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with tables. This is the primary method used by most AWS Glue users. A crawler can crawl multiple data stores in a single run. Upon completion, the crawler creates or updates one or more tables in your Data Catalog

# Classifiers:
-Classifiers are triggered during a crawl task. A classifier checks whether a given file is in a format the crawler can handle. If it is, the classifier creates a schema in the form of a StructType object that matches that data format.

# Trigger in AWS glue :
-trigger starts a job when it Fires

#Workflows :
-A workflow is an orchestration used to visualize and manage the relationship and execution of multiple triggers, jobs and crawlers.

# Blueprints :
-A blueprint is used to generate AWS Glue workflows for common ETL use cases in your organization.

#PARTITIONS IN AWS: 
Folders where data is stored on S3, which are physical entities, are mapped to partitions, which are logical entities i.e. Columns in the Glue table.

#AWS GLUE JOBS:
The business logic that is required to perform ETL work. It is composed of a transformation script, data sources, and data targets. Job runs are initiated by triggers that can be scheduled or triggered by events.

#Step 1 : create crawler to create table using S3 buckets 

Step2:crawler will automatically create data base and table
